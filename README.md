# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the market price of a house based on various features. By analyzing key attributes, we will develop and compare multiple regression models to estimate house prices. The primary evaluation metric used will be the **R-squared (R²) score**, which measures the goodness of fit of our models.

## Features Used for Prediction

The following features will be considered in predicting house prices:

- **Square footage** of the house and/or lot
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Number of bathrooms**
- **Number of floors**
- **Age of the house**
- **Location** (e.g., zip code, neighborhood)
- **Condition or quality** of the house
- Additional features such as **swimming pool**, **garage**, or **garden**

## Project Goals

1. **Data Analysis**: Understand the relationships between the features and house prices.
2. **Model Development**: Apply various regression models to predict house prices, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Polynomial Regression
3. **Model Evaluation**: Compare models based on the **R-squared (R²) score** to identify the best-performing model.

By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to create an effective model for predicting house prices while exploring the factors that most influence the real estate market.

## Key Insights

During the project, we will:
- Explore the dataset to identify significant features that affect house prices.
- Train and test multiple regression models to assess performance.
- Fine-tune models to achieve better predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

The model with the highest **R-squared (R²)** score will be considered the best at predicting house prices. This model will help us understand which features are most impactful in determining the value of a house.
